# CF-Master-Angler-Analysis
Class project that analyzed Michigan Master Angler data. The goal was to potential find relationships between various variables to help anglers catch Master Angler sized fish in the Great Lakes.
# Focus on Size of Fish üé£
  ### What variables may affect the length of fish?
  - Michigan Number of üêü Stocked
  - Zooplankton species in the Great Lakes
- Weight of Fish
### Data Sources:
- Master angler data: DNR (2022). Available at: https://www2.dnr.state.mi.us/masterangler/ (Accessed: 23 June 2022).
- Stocking data: DNR (2022). Available at: https://www2.dnr.state.mi.us/fishstock/ (Accessed: 23 June 2022).
- Zooplankton data (registration required - it is free): Log In | Central Data Exchange | US EPA (2022). Available at: https://cdx.epa.gov/CDX/MyCDX (Accessed: 23 June 2022).
### Analysis Included:
- correlation heatmaps
- pair plots
- scatterplots
- categorical plots
- violin plots
- regression analysis
- cluster analysis
- time-series analysis
### Geographic Feature:
- Great Lakes GEOJSON
### Research Questions:
- null: no variable impacts length of species of fish
### Cleaning Procedures:
- Removed duplicate rows
- Filled missing values for weight or length with average for the species
- Cleaned up bait so that there was consistency in bait names
- Removed all special characters
